<p>The steps in the randomized response survey can be visualized using a <em>tree diagram</em>. The diagram partitions all the survey respondents according to their true and answer and the answer that they eventually give. It also displays the proportions of respondents whose true answers are 1 ("yes") and 0 ("no"), as well as the chances that determine the answers that they give. As in the code above, we have used <em>p</em> to denote the proportion whose true answer is 1.</p>

<p>The respondents who answer 1 split into two groups. The first group consists of the respondents whose true answer and given answers are both 1. If the number of respondents is large, the proportion in this group is likely to be about 2/3 of <em>p</em>. The second group consists of the respondents whose true answer is 0 and given answer is 1. This proportion in this group is likely to be about 1/3 of <em>1-p</em>.</p>
<p>We can observed $p^*$, the proportion of 1's among the given answers. Thus
$$
p^* ~\approx ~ \frac{2}{3} \times p ~+~ \frac{1}{3} \times (1-p)
$$</p>
<p>This allows us to solve for an approximate value of <em>p</em>:
$$
p ~ \approx ~ 3p^* - 1
$$</p>
<p>In this way we can use the observed proportion of 1's to "work backwards" and get an estimate of <em>p</em>, the proportion in which whe are interested.</p>
<p><strong>Technical note.</strong> It is worth noting the conditions under which this estimate is valid. The calculation of the proportions in the two groups whose given answer is 1 relies on <em>each of the groups</em> being large enough so that the Law of Averages allows us to make estimates about how their dice are going to land. This means that it is not only the total number of respondents that has to be large â€“ the number of respondents whose true answer is 1 has to be large, as does the number whose true answer is 0. For this to happen, <em>p</em> must be neither close to 0 nor close to 1. If the characteristic of interest is either extremely rare or extremely common in the population, the method of randomized response described in this example might not work well.</p>
